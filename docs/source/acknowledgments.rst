FANTASIA is the result of a collaborative effort between **Ana Roja’s Lab** (Andalusian Center for Developmental Biology, CSIC) and **Rosa Fernández’s Lab** (Metazoa Phylogenomics Lab, Institute of Evolutionary Biology, CSIC-UPF). This project demonstrates the synergy between research teams with diverse expertise.

This version of FANTASIA builds upon previous work from:

- `Metazoa Phylogenomics Lab's FANTASIA <https://github.com/MetazoaPhylogenomicsLab/FANTASIA>`_
  The original implementation of FANTASIA for functional annotation.

- `bio_embeddings <https://github.com/sacdallago/bio_embeddings>`_
  A state-of-the-art framework for generating protein sequence embeddings.

- `GoPredSim <https://github.com/Rostlab/goPredSim>`_
  A similarity-based approach for Gene Ontology annotation.

- `protein-metamorphisms-is <https://github.com/CBBIO/protein-metamorphisms-is>`_
  Serves as the **reference biological information system**, providing a robust data model and curated datasets for protein structural and functional analysis.

We also extend our gratitude to **LifeHUB-CSIC** for inspiring this initiative and fostering innovation in computational biology.
